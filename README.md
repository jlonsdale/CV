Studying physics has humbled me to the fact that you will never truely know  <em>everything</em>. Theories are constantly developing and evolving, and the only way to succeed is to always keep learning. I believe this principle is analogous to the tech world. With programming you need to keep learning - both continuously in your career and on the fly for a given task. In this way, I find that to be a good developer is to be embrace constantly learning, improving and adapting. Fortunately for me, I find working in such conditions to be incredibly fun and satisfying. I am looking for a backend development role where I can thrive, learn and write exceptional code.

During my degree I used code to acheieve various goals, such as simulating physical relationships using OOP and in depth data analytical work for labratory projects. I pride myself on my ability to write DRY, well-tested and readable code using TDD principles.

## Skills

#### Technical Skills 

I have experience using Python, numPy and matplotLib in various mathematical and physical contexts.
I also have experience with object orientated programming in Java, Ruby and Javascript, and with the relevant testing frameworks such as Rspec and Jasmine. I have built various applications, both solo and by working in groups, using: Rails, Sinatra and NodeJS. I also have worked extensively with jQuery, HTML, CSS. 

#### Mathematical and Data Analytical Skills

I find the approaches in mathematics and programming closely related, and I experience my mathematical studies often give me an advantage in solving a problem using code. Through the mathematical aspects of my studies I've trained a methodical approach to solving highly complex problems as well applying useful strategies for isolating problems and solving bugs - not to mention training my cognitive skills to grasp the complexities of a given problem.

My skills in field include experience with: Regression analysis, Statistical hypothesis testing, Multivariable Calculus, Determinants and Matrices, High-order Differential Equations, Legendre Functions, Fourier Analysis and Group Theory.

#### Communication and Teamwork Skills

I have worked in small and large groups for numerous highly specialized projects throughout my degree and during Makers..
During my projects I obtained experience with project management, utilizing group members strengths, meeting deadlines, delegating work among the team as well as picking up and applying new skills quickly.

During my second year at university I volunteered as a tutor for GCSE Physics and Mathematics to 15-16 year olds at NCS. This gave me experience in explaining complicated concepts in easy-to-understand ways.
