## Jessie Lonsdale

I'm Jessie Lonsdale, a recent physics graduduate from UCL. Through my degree I've acquired keen problem solving skills, teamwork experience and exceptional mathematical capabilities. I find it satisfying applying these skills to solving problems with code and I take pride in the quality of my work.

## Skills

#### Mathematical and Data Analytical Skills
 Python, NumPY, Regression analysis, Statistical hypothesis testing
 Multivariable Calculus, Determinants and Matrices, Differential Equations, Legendre Functions, Fourier Analysis and
 Group Theory.

#### Communication and Teamwork Skills

I have worked in small and large groups for numerous highly specialized projects throughout my degree and during Makers. For example, building a phased array antenna, operating and taking readings from a scanning tunneling microscope and various electronics projects.

During my projects I obtained experience with project management, utilizing group members strengths, meeting deadlines, delegating work among the team as well as picking up and applying new skills quickly.

During my second year at university I volunteered as a tutor for GCSE Physics and Mathematics to 15-16 year olds at NCS. This gave me experience in explaining complicated concepts in easy-to-understand ways.
