Group Theory.

Mathematical Methods I, II and III
Solid State Physics

*note to self attach grade transript.

#### Communication and Teamwork skills

Developing Effecting Communications I and II

I have worked in small and large groups for numerous highly specialised projects. For example, building a phased array antenna, operating and taking reading from a scanning tunneling microscope and various electronics projects.

During my projects I obtained experience with project management, data analysis using Python, utilizing group members strengths, meeting deadlines, delegating work among the team as well as picking up and applying new skills quickly for a project.
